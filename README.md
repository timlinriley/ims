This project utilized product data from the dummyjson.com API. Product data was fetched and displayed in a react-table to mimic how an inventory management systme would display inventory data. A modal/portal was used to select inventory from the API return and create orders. After submitting orders orders can be viewed in the show orders page. On submitting orders at the order modl level an array is created which is passed up to the app component which is then passed down to the show orders componenet.
